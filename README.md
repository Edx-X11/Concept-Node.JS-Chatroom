# Concept-Node.JS-Chatroom
This is a simple chatroom application built using Node.js and WebSocket technology. It allows users to connect to a chatroom server and exchange messages in real-time.

## Features
Real-time Communication: Users can send and receive messages instantly within the chatroom.
Username Registration: Upon connecting to the server, users are prompted to choose a username before joining the chat.
Broadcast Messages: Messages sent by users are broadcasted to all other connected clients.
User Disconnect Handling: When a user disconnects from the server, a notification is sent to all remaining users.
